# Progress bar plugin
A progress bar plugin typically refers to a custom plugin created for the Joget Workflow platform to display progress bars within applications or workflow processes. A progress bar is a graphical representation that shows the completion status of a task or process.

A progress bar plugin can be used to provide visual feedback to users about the status of a workflow process, such as the completion percentage of a task, the overall progress of a form submission, or the advancement of a multi-step process.

The progress bar plugin in Joget Workflow can be customized to match the application's design and can be embedded within forms, userviews, or workflow process steps. It allows users to track their progress, understand where they are in the process, and how much is left to complete.
